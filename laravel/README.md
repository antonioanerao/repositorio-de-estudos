### Torchlight Integration

This project relies on Torchlight for syntax highlighting. You will need to create an account at [torchlight.dev](https://torchlight.dev/) and generate a free personal token for use in this project. Once generated, add your token to your .env file:

```ini
TORCHLIGHT_TOKEN=your-torchlight-token
```
