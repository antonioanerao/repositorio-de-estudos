## Introduction

All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the `config` directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

These configuration files allow you to configure things like your database connection information, your mail server information, as well as various other core configuration values such as your application timezone and encryption key.

### Environment Variable Types

All variables in your `.env` files are typically parsed as strings, so some reserved values have been created to allow you to return a wider range of types from the `env()` function:

| `.env` Value | `env()` Value |
|--------------|---------------|
| true         | (bool) true   |
| (true)       | (bool) true   |
| false        | (bool) false  |
| (false)      | (bool) false  |
| empty        | (string) ''   |
| (empty)      | (string) ''   |
| null         | (null) null   |
| (null)       | (null) null   |

If you need to define an environment variable with a value that contains spaces, you may do so by enclosing the value in double quotes:

```ini
APP_NAME="My Application"
```
